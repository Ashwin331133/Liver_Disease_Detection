# Liver Disease Detection

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to use classification algorithms to detect liver patients from healthy individuals. Three classification algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), were evaluated based on their performance using liver patient data. The algorithm with the highest accuracy was implemented into a user-friendly GUI using Flask in Python, designed to assist doctors and medical practitioners in screening for liver disease.

## Dataset

The dataset used is The Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of 416 liver patient records and 167 non-liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The dataset includes 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records. The "Dataset" column serves as the class label, dividing patients into liver disease and no disease groups.

## Libraries Used

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Flask (for GUI implementation)
- HTML
- CSS

## Conclusion

This project explores methods for diagnosing liver disease using machine learning techniques. Various algorithms including Logistic Regression, KNN, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost Classifier were evaluated. Random Forest emerged as the model with the highest accuracy. A Flask-based GUI was developed to predict liver disease based on the trained Random Forest model. The GUI provides a valuable tool for medical staff in early detection and screening of liver disease in patients.
